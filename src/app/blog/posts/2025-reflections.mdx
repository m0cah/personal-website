To start this post off right, I think it is suitable to first talk about my goals for 2025.

# Goals for 2025
---

1. Graduate with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
2. Get a full time job offer
3. Move into my own apartment
4. Make more friends, and keep contact with existing friends
5. Learn to play my guitar
6. Max out my Roth IRA Yearly Contribution
7. Visit someplace new
8. Finish One Piece

# Looking back, did I achieve these goals?

Some yes, and some no. And that's okay. 2025 was a big year for me. I matured in several areas of my life; As a Christian, as a Student, as a Software Engineer, and in multiple other ways, including physically and mentally.

## 1. Graduate with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
The year started off strong with me taking one of the hardest classes at Virginia Tech: The Computer Systems Capstone. In this class, I was able to build off of a barebones operating system known as PintOS. I implemented several features such as a load balancer, the ability to run binaies, virtual memory, and a filesystem. For the open-ended portion, my team and I were able to migrate our operating system from booting via legacy BIOS to utilizing UEFI. My other classes were not nearly as tedious as this one, allowing me to focus all of my attention on the tasks for this class. Luckily, I was able to finish this class, and graduate Summa Cum Laude with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. A picture of both my final presentation and graduation should be below.

## 2. Get a full time job offer

In the summer of 2024, I had the privilege of interning at Microsoft. I'm honestly not sure how I landed this. In 2024, I completely fumbled the techinical portion of the interview, solving most of the problems bruteforce, and only conceptually explaining the optimal solutions. However, I think the interviewers loved my attitude and persistence. When I interned, I got to meet a ton of amazing people of the team I was working with. They have guided and shaped me into the engineer I am today. Luckily, they liked me and thought that I did good work. This opened the door to a return offer, which I accepted, completing this goal. Below, you'll find a picture of me on my first day of work, taken by my amazing coworker and onboarding buddy.

## 3. Move into my own apartment

This goal is very special to me. Since I was in the Corps of Cadets and ROTC at Virginia Tech, I was forced to stay in the dorms all 4 years of college. I hated this. I longed for my own room and privacy for several reasons. The paramount reason being that I ALWAYS got sick when my roommate got sick. Anyways... After I graduated, I moved up to Northern Virginia to start my job, and got my own apartment, completing this goal! I live with one of my friends from High School. A picture of the apartment is below.

## 4. Make more friends, and keep in contact with existing ones

I very much consider myself an extrovert with a social battery. I love socializing with others, and learning about their upbringing, struggles, interests, and more. Every year, I make it a goal to make more friends, even if the connection is just surface level. In 2025 I made a ton of new friends. Experiences such as joining clubs, going on work trips, and exploring made it extremely easy to find new friends. I was also able to keep in contact with a lot of my existing friends from grade school. I don't usually namedrop, but David Whitacre and I have been friends since kindergarten. This year, we called at least once every week to discuss One Piece. He's even watched stints of it along with me (Even though he is already caught up). I was also able to keep in contact with several others via sports games, video games, and communication via text or Discord. Pictures of me with new and old friends are below :)

## 5. Learn to play my guitar

When I set this goal, I wasn't very clear on what "learn" actually means. To me, it meant being able to pick up my guiater, and easily learn any new song I wanted. Little did I know that this was way harder than I expected. The guitar takes a lot of time and effort to master. Anyone can pick up a guitar and play a couple chords, but the majority of chords and songs require consistent practice, which is something I didn't do. About a month after I moved into my apartment in June, I dedicated 10 minutes a day to learning Guitar, but that fell off after about 2 months, mainly due to me prioritizing other enjoyable things over it, like video games or doomscrolling instagram. While I did learn how to play a few song openings, I unfortunately cannot say that I accomplished this goal.

## 6. Max out my Roth IRA Yearly Contribution

Since social security most likely wont be a thing by the time I retire, I make this a yearly goal. There is not much to say here other than I did achieve this goal.

## 7. Visit someplace new

Over the past few years, I've always reflected on what is important to me. Recently, travelling and exploring the world has become a priority of mine. Growing up, I would always here my about my friends' summer adventures on cruises, or flying abroad to beautiful, luxurious locations. My family rarely did family vacations. As a result, I've made travelling and exploring a big priority now that I make enough money to be able to travel the world. 

This year, I visited a couple new locations. First was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This place was AWESOME! I enjoyed getting to walk around such an impactful place to the United States. Getting to see Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell was such a privilege. Next, I visited Seattle, Washington on a work conference trip. I stayed a total of 10 days, 3 of which staying at Justin and Kaleb's apartment (pics should be below). Seattle was amazing. In my internship, I never made an effort to get super close with any of the other interns (now full time employees), which is my fault. Though, in Seattle I feel like we all became closer. We all had a ton of fun at the conference, dressed up for Halloween, and had a blast. Pictures of them, and the new friends I made in Seattle are below as well.

## 8. Finish One Piece

For those of you who know me, it doesn't take long to realize that I am obsessed with Japanese culture / media. Whether you catch me reading manga on my e-reader, watching anime, see me out in one of my many pieces of Naruto apparel, or notice me wearning Kurapika's judgement chain around my neck, it's immediately evident  that it holds a special place in my life. And, for those of you that don't know what One Piece is, well, let me enlighten you. One Piece, created by Eichiro Oda in 1999, is a fictional story of the "Straw Hats", comprised of Luffy and his crew. Luffy's life goal is to become King of the Pirates. The story is not finished, but, in my opinion, has SEVERAL themes that are representative of the current world. There is government corruption, racism, descrimination, human trafficking, slavery, and more packed into 1150+ episodes of greatness. While the anime is not finished yet, it was my goal to catch all the way up to the current state. Unforunately, I did not meet this goal. Currently, I am on episode 900, and will most likely be fully caught up by the end of January 2026. Though, I can say confidently that One Piece, while only fiction, has completely changed my life. I can, and probably will, make an entire blog post just about One Piece. Below is a pciture of me starting One Piece on January 1st, 2025.

# Biggest Lesson Learned from 2025

Overall, the biggest lesson I learned this year was just to be patient with myself. The world appears to move so, so fast, and it can easily seem like you are falling behind, or you aren't as good as your peers. There were times this year and last year that I really questioned myself, and my abilities. I questioned if Computer Science  was something that I was really interested in. I constantly compared myself to others. I routinely told myself that I wasn't doing enough. I was a teaching assistant telling others that they need to believe in themselves, but those words were empty, as I was incapable of doing so for myself. It wasn't until I slowed down that these thoughts began to dissipate. To be honest, as dark as it sounds, I just stopped caring so much. I stopped caring about what others think of me. I stopped comparing myself to those around me. I stopped caring about making as much money as possible. I stopped telling myself that I couldn't. Instead, I decided to love **the process**. I started to love learnig. I started to love just being myself. I started to love slowing down. Who cares if I make a mistake. Who cares if my code isn't as optimal as another's code. At the end of the day, I am still  learning. Mistakes and failures only propel me further toward my goal of learning. I hope 2026 brings as many, if not more failures than 2025, but also many more successes ;)
